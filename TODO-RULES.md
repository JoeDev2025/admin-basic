# To-Do Tree Pattern and Tags (created by me)

## Goals

- Easier communication
- Confort to keep focus on the current task, without having to jump to new ones or being afraid of forgetting something important

## Tags and Usage 
        
* "REVIEW" => things to discuss -> 'Check if my implementation is correct'

* "NOTE"  => mark an important information -> 'This function is only for testing'

* "TODO" => mark something to be done -> 'Remove this placeholder image when real data is available'

* "FIXME" => mark something to be fixed -> 'This component is causing an error'

* "REFACTOR" => mark something that might be optimized IN THE FUTURE -> 'Simplify this query for better performance'
